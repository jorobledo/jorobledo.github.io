  <h1> About me </h1>
  <p> I'm currently living in <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BClich">Jülich</a>. Beforehand I lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariloche"> Bariloche </a> but I was born in 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Argentina"> Córdoba </a>, Argentina. 
    I have a Licenciate in physics Degree (roughly equivalent to a Ms.Sc.) 
    and a PhD in physics. I recieved both degrees from the <a href="https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/"> Faculty of Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics and Computation (FaMAF)</a>
    of <a href="https://www.unc.edu.ar/">Córdoba's National University</a>. I've also completed a master's study
    in Applied Statistics at the 
    <a href="https://www.eco.unc.edu.ar/">Faculty of Economics</a> of the same institution.
  </p>
  
  <p> I enjoy listening and playing Music. I've also dabbled in a few Luthiery projects of my own, having constructed a pair of classical guitars, which you can see below!</p>

  <p> If you are interested in my scientific research, then head over to my <a href="../cv">CV.</a>
     I've studied X-Ray and Neutron interaction with matter (my phycisist side) and a lot of statistics and machine learning (my computer scientist side). 
    Still don't decide which is the dark side though &#128516 .  </p>
