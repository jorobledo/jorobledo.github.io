  <h1> About me </h1>
  <p> I'm an Argentinean physicist, currently living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariloche"> Bariloche </a>. I was born in 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Argentina"> Córdoba </a>, Argentina on June 8 1990. 
    I have a Licenciate in physics Degree (roughly equivalent to a Ms.Sc.) 
    and a PhD in physics. I recieved both degrees from the <a href="https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/"> Faculty of Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics and Computation (FaMAF)</a>
    of <a href="https://www.unc.edu.ar/">Córdoba's National University</a>. I've also completed a master's study
    in Applied Statistics at the 
    <a href="https://www.eco.unc.edu.ar/">Faculty of Economics</a> of the same institution.
  </p>
  
  <p> I enjoy listening and playing Music. I've also dabbled in a few Luthiery projects of my own, having constructed a pair of classical guitars.</p>
