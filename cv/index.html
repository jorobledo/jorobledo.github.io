		<h2>Current position</h2>
		
		<p> - Artificial Intelligence Consultant. <a href="https://www.helmholtz.ai/">Helmholtz Artificial Intelligente cooperation unit</a>, member of Stefan Kesselheim's consultant team located at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre.</p>

		</p>
		<h2>Previous positions</h2>

		<p>- Post-doc at Forschungszentrum Jülich, granted by the <a hreh="https://gneus.eu/">Global Neutron Scientists (GNeuS)</a> project. This project receives funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement N°101034266. Developed novel methodologies for interpreting Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) data by means of Machine Learning algorithms. 
			
		<p> - Post-doc granted by CONICET at the Neutron Physics department of the Bariloche Atomic Center (CAB-CNEA), 
			Bariloche, Argentina. Studied Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering (DINS) and Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS).
			Retrieved total cross section and diffraction information from spectra collected at the VESUVIO beamline at the ISIS pulsed neutron 
			source, UK. Also simulated SANS images of the V4 SANS instrument to be installed at 
			<a href="https://www.lahn.cnea.gov.ar/">LAHN-RA10</a>, and trained machine 
			learning models for image classification. All our developments for neutron spectral analysis were programmed in Python, and were 
			focused on the <a href="https://www.mantidproject.org/">MANTID</a> framework.
